# Plugin Description:
When the server is full (not having in mind reserved slots), you will join the queue when trying to log in. You will get a position and you must reconnect within some amount of minutes to keep your position. If the available slots are higher or equals to your queue position, you will join the server the next time you try to log in.
All messages that are shown are always on the kick screen (instead of the typical "server is full!").
	
# Permissions
- **queue.priority** -> Gives a player priority when joining the queue
- **queue.leavingqueue** -> When that player leaves the server, joins with priority to the queue (even if the player does not have priority permisison)
- **queue.reserved** -> Gives a player permission to join on a reserved slot
