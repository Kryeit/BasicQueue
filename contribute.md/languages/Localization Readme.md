Hey there! 
Here's how you can contribute to a localization:


1. Check if your language is not translated and if it is, if it's outdated:

You can compare it to "en_en.yml". If it's not translated you can copy the en_en.yml and paste it inside the same folder.
Change the new pasted file name to the language you are translating it.

2. Publishing your changes:

Simply use the Github Desktop App. Download the whole project and use some simple editor (Notepad++, VSCode, etc.)
to make your changes. Once you have done that, just opening the Desktop App will show all the changes you have made.
Make a PR to this repository, either by creating your own fork or just direct PR.
